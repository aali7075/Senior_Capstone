# Simulation assumptions

# 1) The interaction between magnetic field is additive
# 2) The magnetic field scales proportionally to the current and the number of coils
# 3) The coils are 2 dimensional, they exist on a plane and have no volume
# 4) All coils on a wall are co-planar
# 5) All coils on a wall have the exact same dimensions
# 6) The spacing between the edges of all coils on a wall are equal
# 7) All coils are perfectly rectangular
