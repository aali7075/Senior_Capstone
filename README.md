## Installation:
For this project you must have the following software. 
NOTE: This is only for Windows. CU Boulder only offers labview student suite for free which is only for Windows. You can technically run this in Linux if you spend $500 a month for the regular version on Linux.

Labview and Python. You must make sure that the bit value is the same for both. Either both are 64 bit or 32 bit. Also, currently only Python 3.8.10 works without issue.
